Analyzing Price Dynamics of Popular Indie Games on Steam Post-COVID-19 Pandemic using SteamDB.

## Abstract

This course work investigates the price dynamics of the most popular indie games on the Steam platform in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging SteamDB, a comprehensive database providing detailed information on games available on Steam, the study delves into the pricing strategies adopted by indie game developers and publishers in response to the pandemic's global impact on the gaming industry.

## Introduction

The term “Indiepocalypse” is a colloquial expression used within the indie game development community. It is often used to describe the challenges and changes in the indie game industry that arise from factors such as increased competition, market saturation, changing consumer expectations, and the evolving dynamics of digital distribution platforms [1].
Indie games experienced a surge in visibility and popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic as people sought diverse and engaging entertainment. The agility of indie developers, coupled with increased attention from gamers looking for unique experiences, contributed to a notable boost in the indie gaming scene. The pandemic highlighted the resilience and creativity of indie developers, who often adapted more swiftly to the changing landscape compared to larger studios [2, 3, 4].
SteamDB played a vital role during the pandemic, offering developers real-time insights for strategy adjustments, providing gamers with updates and pricing information, and serving as a valuable resource for researchers analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on indie games on the Steam platform [5].

## Methodology

Primary tool for data collection for future analysis will be SteamDB. SteamDB contains a wealth of valuable information about games on Steam. Here, one can select the appropriate game genre (Figure 1)

By utilizing the obtained data, one can analyze the price dynamics before and after the pandemic, using this information to assess future indie games, evaluate buyer trends, and predict optimal pricing strategies.
